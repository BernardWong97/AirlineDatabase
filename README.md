# Airline Database

This project is for my advance procedural programming (C programming language) assignment project.  
XYZ Airport are currently recording passenger travel statistics into Ireland and has requested
me to develop a new passenger statistic application for them.  
This program will create a database which will store the details of all the passengers travel
statistics. In addition to storing all the passenger data the application should allow overall
travel statistics to be generated.
